# Feature-Engineerig-For-Machine-Learning

This repository contains small use cases of algorithms referenced in [Feature Engeneering for Machine Learning and Data Analytics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39669557-feature-engineering-for-machine-learning-and-data-analytics) using *Python*.

Since the book is focused mostly for feature engineering, the small use cases are used to generated features and use those features in common machine learning models in order to generate some output.
